# My-personal-portfolio
Building my personal portfolio website.
Before pushing the project in this repository i did the the whole project within a week and committed all the changes in another repository.
But because of some LFS (Large file system) error i wasn't able to push some large files in that repository.
So i created this repository and pushed the large files first by installing git LFS and then just added the remaining files in this repository.
That's why the time period between two commits is very less .
Just realized that it was a bad idea to push large files (Videos) in the repository .
So i removed all the videos from the repository and replaced all the videos by the related images.
I didn't made this portfolio mobile responsive before.
Now i am using media queries to give responsiveness to the postfolio.
And just done with adding the media queries for different devices.
Just noticed this portfolio is responsive for most of the different sized devices but not all (like the device with size more than 1245px).
But i will be definitely going to work on that in some days .
